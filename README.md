Welcome to the Malware Detection and Vulnerability Analysis Project! This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for identifying potential vulnerabilities and malware threats across various platforms, including websites, APK files, and network configurations. Leveraging data from trusted sources like CVE, Exploit-DB, VirusTotal, and more, this project integrates machine learning to provide actionable insights and enhance cybersecurity defenses.

Features
Data Integration: Aggregates data from multiple sources, including CVE, Exploit-DB, VirusTotal, and network analysis tools.
Feature Engineering: Transforms raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict vulnerabilities based on historical data and current threats.
Modular Design: Organized into separate modules for data fetching, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
Logging: Comprehensive logging system for tracking data processing and model performance.
Directory Structure
config/: Contains configuration files for API endpoints and model parameters.
data/: JSON files with sample data for CVE, exploits, VirusTotal, network analysis, and APK analysis.
src/: Source code for data fetching, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
data_fetcher.py: Functions for retrieving and loading data from various sources.
feature_engineering.py: Creates feature sets for machine learning from raw data.
model_trainer.py: Trains a machine learning model on the feature set.
predictor.py: Makes predictions using the trained model.
logger.py: Configures and handles logging for the project.
main.py: The entry point of the project, which orchestrates data fetching, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
Installation and Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware_detection_project.git
cd malware_detection_project
Set Up the Environment: Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Script: Execute the main script to start the project:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will process the data, train the model, and make predictions.

Configuration
Modify the config/api_config.json and config/model_config.json files to set your API keys and model parameters.
